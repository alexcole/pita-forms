pita-forms
==========

In "Generalized D-Forms Have No Spurious Creases", Erik D. Demaine and Gregory N. Price show that "pita-forms" (or 3-D shapes created by sewing a smooth convex shape along its border) can only have 1 crease (aside from its seam). Here we present Mathematica code and a writeup about a pita form with no creases aside from its seam.
